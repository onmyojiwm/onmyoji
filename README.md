## Introduction
Onmyoji is a dynamic tiling Wayland compositor built using wlroots and written in Zig. It aims to provide a desktop environment-like experience by incorporating features like an integrated bar, app launcher, and GTK shell.

The main repository is held on [GitHub](https://github.com/onmyojiwm/onmyoji "A dynamic tiling Wayland compositor using wlroots and written in Zig."), which is where the issue tracker is located and where issues and contributions can be submitted.  
A read-only mirror is held on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/onmyoji/onmyoji "A dynamic tiling Wayland compositor using wlroots and written in Zig.").  

```
Note: Onmyoji is still in active development and has yet to have a major release, as such breaking changes may be introduced at any point during development until a major version is created.
